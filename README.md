## logtime.py

Simple CLI time logging application.

Meant to track what you just finished working on, and deliver readable text output.

## Installation
```bash
pip install logtime-cli
```

## Help
```
lt --help
```

## Usage
To log time:
```
lt what I just finished doing
```

To open your daily log file:
```
lt
```
To open a previous daily log file:
```
lt -p
lt -p 2 //opens daily log from 2 days ago
```

To log time with an end date:
```
lt -e 07:15p what I did during that time
lt -e 19:15 what I did during that time
lt -e 0715p what I did during that time
lt -e 1915 what I did during that time
```

To log time with a start and end date:
```
lt -s 07:15a -e 07:30a what I did during that time
```

## Example workflows
```
lt what I just finished doing
```
```
lt -s 0700 what I just finished doing, when this is the first thing I logged today
```
```
lt -e 1100 what I know I stopped doing at 1100, but forgot to log
lt what I just finished doing
```
```
lt -b what I am about to do, when this is the first thing I logged in a while
# ... later, when I'm done ...
lt -c
```

## Additional options
- `--pie` will display a pie chart of today's time log

## Configuration
In your installation directory (with pip, `C:\<PATH_TO_PYTHON>\Lib\site-packages\logtime-cli`), you'll find a file `config/config-default.ini`.

Copy that file to `config/config-user.ini`, and change that file as needed.

- **`new_day_start_time`** affects what time each day is assumed to start at for the first call of `lt something`. Example: `10:00 AM`
- **`logfile_directory`** is where the logtime files get stored. Works on relative and absolute paths. Example: `C:\...\Dropbox\logtime-logs`

## Bash autocomplete
`click` builds an autocomplete script for us. To make use it, put the following in your .bashrc:

```
eval "$(_LT_COMPLETE=source lt)"
```
